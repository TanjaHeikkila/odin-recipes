    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bell peppers filled with savory ground beef, rice, and melty cheese — a comfort classic that tastes like a hug in a roasted shell. It’s the kind of meal that makes neighbors jealous.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 bell peppers, any color</li>
        <li>3 cups chunky tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 ts red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly shredded cheese</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley chopped</li>
        <li>1 ts salt and black pepper or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the peppers: Cut off tops, scoop out seeds, and lightly roast or blanch the peppers to soften.</li>
        <li>Brown the beef: Sauté ground beef with onion and garlic until golden.</li>
        <li>Flavor bomb: Stir in tomato paste, cooked rice, herbs (oregano, thyme), and salt & pepper.</li>
        <li>Cheese magic: Mix in shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or whatever you love).</li>
        <li>Fill 'em up: Stuff the peppers generously with the beef-rice mixture.</li>
        <li>Top it off: Sprinkle with more cheese or breadcrumbs for a golden crown.</li>
        <li>Bake to glory: Place in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake at 190 °C (375 °F) for 25–30 min.</li>
        <li>Final melt: Remove foil for the last 5–10 min to brown the top. Serve warm and proud.</li>
    </ol>
