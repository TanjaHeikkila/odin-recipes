# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website - the website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

write a brief introduction describing what the current project is
and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it.
(You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

The aim of this project is to begin to learn creating websites.

In the first assignment of this project, I began using basic HTML boilerplate, common tags and attributes often used with them, adding content to a website,
linking between pages and practised making Git commits at reasionable points during code writing.
